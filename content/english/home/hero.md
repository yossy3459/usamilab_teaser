The most advanced computers are now confronted with a serious crisis<br>
**--- Performance cannot be further raised due to their Power Dissipation.**<br>
In order to effectively reduce power while achieving high performance, what design technology should we use?<br>
We are challenging this research topic from architecture and circuit design techniques up to LSI design methodologies.
