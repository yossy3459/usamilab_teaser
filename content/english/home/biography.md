# Prof's Biography

Dr. Kimiyoshi Usami is a full professor at Shibaura Institute of Technology. His current research projects are in the area of architecture and circuit-level design techniques,design methodologies and CAD techniques for low power processor design.

One of the major topics that he is focusing on is run-time leakage power control. In the total power dissipation in CMOS LSI chips, dynamic (or switching) power has been a major contributor so far. However, as device technologies move forward, leakage power is growing exponentially; some have predicted that leakage and dynamic power will have almost equal share in the total power within three chip generations. With this in mind, Prof. Usami's group has been studying fundamental design issues in power-gating technique through collaboration with industry, such as Toshiba, Renesas Technology, and Sequence Design Inc. In October 2006, he started a research project by collaborating with three faculty members from the University of Tokyo, Keio University and Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology to study a new paradigm to control leakage and dynamic power. The key of this project is to develop an innovative power-control scheme for system LSI's in which each layer of circuit implementation, architecture, complier and operating system closely cooperates together. This research is promoted under the CREST project supported by Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).


Prof. Usami received BS, MS and Dr. Eng degrees from Waseda University in Tokyo in 1982, 1984 and 2000, respectively. He joined Toshiba in 1984 and worked on VLSI design of CPU chips including TRON microprocessors. From 1993 through 1995, he studied at Stanford University as a visiting scholar, doing research under Prof. Mark Horowitz in the field of low-power design and VLSI CAD. After going back to Toshiba, he was responsible for the research and development of low-power design methodology and CAD systems. The techniques include dual-Vdd methodology to reduce dynamic power and Selective MT using power gating to reduce leakage power. In 2003, he joined the Department of Information Science and Engineering at Shibaura Institute of Technology as an associate professor. He became a full professor in 2005 and has been serving as a department head since 2006.

He teaches six classes for undergrad students: three lecture classes for Computer Architecture 1, 2, and Engineering on Integrated Circuit, two classes for Exercise on Computer and Information Engineering, and Pre-Seminar on Graduation Thesis. For graduate students, he teaches a lecture class on Advanced Computer Architecture.

Prof. Usami is a member of IEEE, ACM, and IEICE in Japan. He served as a Program Committee member for IEEE International Symposium on Low-Power Electronics and Design (ISLPED) from 1999 to 2006, and also for IEEE International Conference on Computer Design (ICCD) from 2000 to 2004. He has been serving as a committee member for IEICE Technical Group on VLSI Design Technologies since 2001, and served as a secretary from 2001 to 2003.


He coauthored two books: Leakage in Nanometer CMOS Technologies (Springer, 2006), and Low-power High-speed LSI Circuits & Technology (in Japanese, Realize Inc., 1998).
